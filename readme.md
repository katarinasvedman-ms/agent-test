### Multi-Platform Access
- **Web Interface**: Access tasks through a web application, ensuring availability on various devices.
- **Mobile Interface**: A mobile-friendly interface to manage tasks on-the-go.

## Architecture

The Todo List Application is built using C# and architected to run on Azure, ensuring high performance, cost-effectiveness, and security. It adheres to the principles of the Well-Architected Framework.

### Backend

#### API Layer
- The backend is structured as a RESTful API, facilitating communication between the frontend and the database.
- Developed using ASP.NET Core to leverage its high performance and support for modern web development practices.

#### Azure Services

- **Azure Functions**: Serverless compute service to run backend operations with auto-scaling capabilities and event-driven execution.
- **Azure Cosmos DB**: Globally distributed, multi-model database service for high availability and low latency.
- **Azure Blob Storage**: For storing files such as attachments that users may upload related to tasks.

### Frontend

#### Web Application
- Built using Blazor for a rich, interactive user interface that runs on WebAssembly for near-native performance.
- Responsive design to ensure compatibility across different screen sizes and devices.

#### Mobile Application
- Xamarin.Forms or MAUI (Multi-platform App UI) for cross-platform mobile app development to share code between Android and iOS apps.

### Deployment and Operations

- **Azure DevOps**: CI/CD pipeline for automated testing, building, and deployment to Azure.
- **Azure Monitor**: For performance monitoring, logging, and alerting.
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)**: For secure authentication and authorization.

## Running the Application

To run the Todo List Application on your local machine or a development environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file in Visual Studio.
3. Restore all NuGet packages.
4. Ensure local settings are configured for connecting to Azure services (Cosmos DB, Blob Storage).
5. Start the backend API project which will host the RESTful API on your local IIS Express.
6. Run the frontend project to launch the web interface.
7. For mobile, ensure the mobile development environment is set up and run the mobile app project.

## Security Considerations

- All communication between the frontend and backend is secured using HTTPS.
- Authentication is managed via Azure Active Directory, providing secure access control.
- Data at rest is encrypted using Azure's built-in encryption capabilities.
